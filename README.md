Despite the different repository name, this a drop-in replacement/fork of
[github.com/chzyer/readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline).

# Forked from chzyer's readline

This is a friendly maintained fork of [github.com/chzyer/readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline)
mostly by [Antoine Catton](https://antoine.catton.fr) and anybody who wants to help.
This fork is maintained on a best-effort basis.

If [chzyer](https://github.com/chzyer) wants to merge back this fork into
the main [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline), we will be more than
happy to assist them in doing that.

We are very grateful towards [chzyer](https://github.com/chzyer)'s original work.
